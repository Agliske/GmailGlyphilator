string1 = """The American Stroke Association, part of the American Heart Association, has shared @umasschan research that suggests an AI model using data from electrocardiograms may be able to 
detect premature aging and cognitive decline."I think AI is making its way into clinical settings," said Bernard Ofosuhene, a clinical research coordinator in the Department of Medicine and lead author of the preliminary study. "It leverages what we already know in terms of clinical medicine or even research, and makes diagnosis easier. If AI models are developed, they could 
lead to timely intervention." Ofosuhene, an Anna Maria College alum, will be presenting on the research next week at the International Stroke Conference. Click the link in our bio to discover how the age-predictor AI model developed by Ofoshune and his colleagues at UMass Chan and the Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine found links between ECG-age and cognitive performance. ❤️🧠⬆️#whyumasschan #AI #ISC25 @umass_medicine @bostonu @american_heart @goannamaria"""
