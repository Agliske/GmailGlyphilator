It also decreased the \"pajama time\" spent reviewing patient cases after working hours, according to a new  study conducted by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.This small study shows early but promising results. In an era where we need find ways to decrease physician burnout and increase the workforce of primary care providers, these results provide a glimmer of hope.\"Kevin B. Johnson, MD, MS, the David L. Cohen University Professor at Penn and the director of the Artificial Intelligence for Ambulatory Care (AI4AI) Lab at Penn MedicinePenn Medicine is in the early stages of working with a \"scribe\" tool that uses artificial intelligence to decipher the conversations between doctors and patients and take accurate notes in the patients' electronic health records (EHRs). Currently, a group of volunteer clinicians are using this \"ambient listening\" tool with patients who have given permission for it to be used during their visits.For the study, 46 clinicians participating in the early phase of the project completed a survey. Johnson and his team found a 20 percent decrease in the clinicians' time spent interacting with EHRs during and after patient visits, with a 30 percent decrease in time spent after working hours, dubbed \"pajama time\" by some because it usually takes place at home, at night.In pure time measures, that translated to a two-minute increase in time that could be spent directly conversing with patients, face-to-face, per visit. Additionally, the analysis found that clinicians gained approximately 15 minutes of personal time at home, each day, that otherwise had been spent working in the EHR. One of the doctors responded in the survey that the AI scribe was \"cutting back on my documentation time by about two hours, cumulative, each week.\"This time savings is important for both clinicians and patients. Many patients have follow-up questions or important information to share at the end of an appointment, so having even just a few extra minutes could be critical in reassuring or informing a patient about their condition.The AI scribe \"has dramatically decreased my documentation burden and allowed me to have conversations with patients that don't require me to divert attention from the computer screen,\" one physician said in the study's survey.At the end of the study period, clinicians they were asked whether they found the system easy to use and if they would recommend it to others.Whether they'd recommend the system to others, on a scale of 0 to 10 (10 being certain to recommend), approximately 65 percent were either \"promoters\" of the system (responding with a 9 or 10), or \"passive\" recommenders (7 or 8).According to co-author C. William Hanson, III, MD, UPHS Chief Medical Information Officer and a professor of Anesthesiology and Clinical Care, different types of doctors document in different ways-for example, an ophthalmologist's notes differ from those of an internist. These notes often have many different readers including colleagues, regulators, insurers and patients.\"Virtual scribe technology is getting better every day at answering those varied requirements,\" Hanson said.One doctor commented to the researchers, \"I legitimately think this technology, once optimized, is the biggest advancement for outpatient primary care providers in decades.\"Anna Schoenbaum, DNP, MS, RN-BC, FHIMSS, UPHS Vice President of Applications and Digital Health, added that Penn Medicine is \"leveraging technology to strengthen the clinician-patient relationship, and this study highlights how AI tools like ambient listening can improve efficiency, reduce cognitive burdens, and restore valuable time for both providers and patients.\".

(February 22, 2025) Artificial Intelligence: A New Frontier in Rare Disease Early Diagnosis. Cureus 17(2): e79487. doi:10.7759/cureus.79487\nRare diseases present significant challenges, including delays in diagnosis, inadequate treatment responses, and difficulties in monitoring. These challenges arise from the complexity of symptoms, limited medical expertise, and insufficient diagnostic tools. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained attention for its potential to improve healthcare, particularly in diagnosing complex conditions. By analyzing large datasets, recognizing patterns, and integrating clinical information, AI can refine diagnostic accuracy, enhance treatment strategies, and improve patient outcomes.This literature review examines AI applications in\u00a0three key areas of rare disease diagnosis:\u00a0genetic analysis, imaging-based phenotyping, and natural language processing (NLP) for clinical data extraction.\u00a0AI-driven advancements in these domains have been explored to improve disease detection and management. However, several challenges persist, including limited data availability, algorithm transparency, privacy considerations, and ethical concerns. Efforts such as data augmentation and transfer learning are being explored to address these issues and expand AI\u2019s role in clinical practice.By refining diagnostic processes and optimizing treatment strategies, AI has the potential to improve the management of rare diseases. This review critically examines AI's role in rare disease diagnosis, with a particular emphasis on its applications in\u00a0genetic analysis, imaging-based phenotyping, and NLP, while also addressing key challenges and future directions for clinical integration.More than 350 million people worldwide are afflicted by more than 7,000 rare diseases (RDs), each of which affects a comparatively small number of patients. However, obtaining a timely and accurate diagnosis remains a significant challenge. Patients with rare disorders typically search for a proper diagnosis for six years after their symptoms first appear . According to a 2013 survey, patients with uncommon diseases often must wait an average of more than five years, seeing eight different doctors and going through two to three misdiagnoses before a proper diagnosis is made . Moreover, RDs are difficult for physicians to diagnose quickly because of their complexity, unpredictability, lack of specific symptoms, and general lack of knowledge about such conditions These challenges arise due to the low prevalence of specific rare diseases, a scarcity of experts, limited accessibility to specialists, and inadequate infrastructure and funding for RD research. The use of computer-based support to enhance clinical workflows is an emerging technology, especially in the fields of AI and machine learning (ML), to overcome these challenges . Furthermore, ML methods have been applied to phenotyping and drug discovery, as well as a number of healthcare domains, such as disease diagnosis, prediction of disease onset, mortality, and length of hospital stay. Consequently, using deep learning (DL) to solve the complexity related to rare diseases has garnered a lot of interest AI refers to the capability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, including learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Numerous AI algorithms provide noteworthy advantages in supporting the diagnosis of RDs\u00a0and non-RDs. A branch of AI called ML\u00a0allows machines to learn from their experiences and become more efficient without the need for explicit programming. Through three main types of algorithms, ML\u00a0plays a critical role in diagnosis: (a) unsupervised, which recognizes patterns; (b) supervised, which classifies or predicts based on prior examples; and (c) reinforcement learning, which uses reward and punishment processes to generate strategies for overcoming particular obstacles. A subset of ML techniques called DL\u00a0is focused on picture recognition. By breaking down complex mappings into groups of simpler ones, DL allows for more effective analysis . Finally, a large amount of the human variability and bias inherent in translating data from medical records can be eliminated by using natural language processing (NLP), a branch of AI that focuses on understanding human language While AI has been broadly applied to various areas of healthcare, this review specifically focuses on three critical applications of AI in rare disease diagnosis: (1) genetic analysis, (2) imaging-based phenotyping, and (3) natural language processing (NLP) for clinical data extraction.\u00a0These areas were chosen because they represent the most promising and actively researched AI-driven approaches for addressing the challenges of rare disease diagnosis.Given AI's growing role in rare disease diagnosis, this review seeks to answer the following question: How has AI contributed to early and accurate rare disease diagnosis, and what challenges must be overcome for its broader clinical adoption? To address this question, the review examines AI applications in these three domains:1. Genetic Analysis:\u00a0Many rare diseases have a genetic basis, and AI-driven approaches have been developed to enhance the interpretation of genomic data, identify pathogenic variants, and improve diagnostic accuracy.2. Imaging-Based Phenotyping:\u00a0AI, particularly deep learning, has shown significant promise in identifying disease-associated patterns in medical imaging, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of rare diseases.3. NLP:\u00a0AI-powered NLP techniques can extract meaningful insights from unstructured clinical data, including physician notes and electronic health records, to support the identification of rare diseases that might otherwise be missed.By systematically analyzing AI\u2019s contributions, current limitations, and future research directions in these three domains, this review provides a structured evaluation of AI\u2019s role in rare disease diagnosis and explores the necessary steps for its broader clinical adoption.\u00a0illustrates the various applications of AI and ML in problem-solving and decision-making processes.To diagnose RDs, first-generation AI focuses on making clinical choices by evaluating large datasets. However, one of the biggest obstacles facing RDs is the lack of initial data inputs. On the other hand, second-generation AI looks for clinical hints that are frequently missed in the initial phases of RD detection. This approach efficiently supports early diagnosis, enabling intervention and prevention for a range of RDs. For example, ML has been used recently to identify individuals with systemic sclerosis who are at a high risk of serious consequences and to identify organ involvement early AI and ML are currently being used in healthcare settings to improve medical image processing, forecast and prevent illnesses, and optimize hospital operations. Healthcare professionals can diagnose and treat patients more accurately and efficiently by utilizing these technologies. Moreover, doctors may be able to diagnose, treat, and manage patients more quickly with the help of AI and ML, which would eventually improve patient outcomes This article explores the innovative potential of AI in aiding healthcare professionals to identify patients promptly and accurately with rare diseases, consequently, lessening the time required for diagnosis and thus enhancing their chances of receiving timely medical attention.This review was conducted by manually collecting relevant literature from multiple databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, UpToDate, and Google Scholar, covering studies published between January 2013 and January 2025. The following keywords were used to identify relevant articles:\u00a0\u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d, \u201cAI\u201d, \u201cScreening\u201d, \u201cRare Diseases\u201d, \u201cultra-rare disease\u201d, \u201cmachine learning\u201d, \u201cdeep learning\u201d, and \u201cOrphan diseases\u201d.A total of\u00a028 articles\u00a0met the inclusion criteria for this review. Studies were selected based on their relevance to AI applications in rare disease diagnosis, with a focus on\u00a0genetic analysis, imaging-based phenotyping, and NLP. Articles were included if they were\u00a0peer-reviewed, published in\u00a0English, and provided\u00a0empirical evidence, systematic reviews, or advancements in AI methodologies related to rare disease diagnosis. Studies that focused solely on\u00a0AI applications in common diseases, did not discuss genetic analysis, imaging, or NLP, or were\u00a0preprints, opinion pieces, or non-peer-reviewed sources\u00a0were excluded.\u00a0The study selection process is illustrated in the PRISMA flowchart (Figure The selected studies were analyzed to identify\u00a0common trends, advancements, limitations, and future directions\u00a0in AI-driven rare disease diagnosis. This qualitative synthesis provides an overview of AI\u2019s impact on rare disease diagnostics across genetic, imaging, and NLP-based approaches.A general assessment of potential biases in the included studies was conducted based on key methodological factors such as selection criteria, study design, data sources, and funding disclosures. While no formal risk of bias tool was applied, considerations were made regarding potential limitations that could influence the findings.Overall, some studies exhibited limitations related to sample size, potential conflicts of interest, and selective reporting. However, efforts were made to include peer-reviewed studies and reputable sources to enhance the credibility of this review. Future research should aim to adopt more standardized methodologies to minimize bias and improve reproducibility.AI has emerged as a powerful tool in rare disease diagnosis, integrating diverse data sources to enhance accuracy and early detection . It is currently regularly employed, and a part of diagnostic workups in highly specialized centers for the diagnosis and management of diseases in oncology, rheumatology, and genetics . Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in the application of these technologies and methods to aid in the diagnosis of rare diseases.Since 80% of rare diseases in literature have an underlying genetic cause, the application of AI has proved to be quite useful . Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the process of sorting through millions of DNA sequences, which when combined with AI can help in the detection of genetic anomalies . AI algorithms play an important role in enhancing and automating various aspects of NGS data analysis, leading to increased precision and efficiency. One of the most important applications of AI in NGS data analysis is to align the sequences to a reference genome which is crucial for the detection of gene variations and mutations. AI excels in this task and facilitates the development of novel tools for NGS data interpretation Many different tools have been developed using NGS to aid in the diagnosis of Mendelian diseases. PhenIX is one such tool which integrates genetic analysis with phenotypic appearance. It reads the patient's genotype, finds any genetic variants and then prioritizes these based on the phenotypic appearance of the patient. Another tool, Xrare does the same . In addition to this, these tools can predict the pathogenicity of genes, discover molecular markers, and create predictive models based on gene expression data. AI can quickly scan and sort through large genetic datasets, which is not possible by humans A study assessed Fabric GEM (Fabric Genomics, Oakland, CA, USA), a new AI-based tool for hastening genome interpretation (whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES)), on a retrospective cohort of 119 patients diagnosed with rare genetic diseases in addition to a separate cohort of 60 cases from different academic centers. GEM identified over 90% of the causative genes as the top or second candidate and identified the causative structural variant (SV) as the top candidate in 17 of 20 patients with diagnostic SVs AI, especially ML, has also been applied to the field of epigenetics. Epigenetic modifications have been identified in many rare diseases including Rett syndrome, hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type 1E, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome The increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) globally is advancing data mining in healthcare. Data from EHRs can be structured (as in constrained choices via drop-down menus, check boxes, and pre-filled templates) and unstructured (as in free text narratives/notes used by healthcare professionals) This is a promising field where data from these sources can be used to develop models to support early diagnosis. NLP\u00a0is a subset of AI which is concerned with understanding, analyzing, and interpreting the human language . NLP technology can be used along with Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to convert health providers\u2019 notes and narratives into structured, standardized formats, which can then further be interpreted for establishing natural history and assisting in early diagnosis of a variety of diseases, including rare diseases . This approach is based on the premise that these data capture unique insights from experienced physicians, which might otherwise be overlooked in formal measurements or purely biological assessments A study conducted used NLP and UMLS to study a cohort of Dravet syndrome (DS) which presents with the onset of epileptic encephalopathy in the first year of life, characterized by febrile seizures and convulsive status epilepticus, and a cohort of febrile seizures not linked to an underlying disorder. The results showed the presence of certain keywords and concepts specific to DS diagnosis in the medical records which were automatically detected by the software using NLP. This approach represents a new methodology that can help flag such symptoms and decrease the time to diagnose DS and could also be extrapolated to other rare diseases Another study validated a novel, state-of-the-art NLP algorithm for the detection of red flag symptoms of multisystemic hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) polyneuropathy from EHRs, in a retrospective sample of 1015 patients. The accuracy of the algorithm was compared with a manual standard on a random sample of 300 patients. There was high accuracy in the detection of red flag symptoms, which showed F1 scores between 0.88 and 0.98. There was a relative increase of 48.6% in genetic testing, which has implications for earlier detection of patients with a rare disease AI has been used for retrospective screening of over 300,000 unstructured EHRs for flagging patients for Pompe\u2019s disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS-II). The algorithms had a specificity of 18.27% for Pompe\u2019s disease, which is crucial as it is a progressive but treatable debilitating neuromuscular disease . DL\u00a0is a subset of ML\u00a0which is involved in image processing. DL algorithms can break down complex imaging mappings into simpler mappings which allows for highly efficient analysis. The algorithm then uses these simpler mappings to read the image and derive important information from it. DL provides superior recognition and can process large amounts of data in a very short time, which can aid in a swift and accurate diagnosis. AI has been shown to have a higher flexibility and scalability as compared to traditional biometrics, which has contributed to early detection, superior efficiency and understanding of complex relationships DeepGestalt (FDNA, Atlanta, GA, USA) is one such deep-learning facial analysis framework used for the classification of genetic diseases. DeepGestalt has been applied in multiple studies for rare disease diagnosis, demonstrating moderate to high accuracy. These diseases include Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Emanuel syndrome, and Pallister-Killian syndrome. It can differentiate between 200 RDs and is able to achieve 91% accuracy in getting the correct diagnosis in the top 10 results . In one study, DeepGestalt was applied for the analysis of facial phenotypes of 25 individuals with KBG syndrome. KBG syndrome was identified as the first (most probable) diagnosis in 28% of patients, second in 40%, and third or fourth for 12%. Overall, KBG syndrome was identified as a potential diagnosis as the top five differentials in 80% of individuals Face2Gene (FDNA, Atlanta, GA, USA) is another software that uses DL to analyze facial photographs and help in the diagnosis of rare diseases . Other algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been used in the diagnosis of rare diseases like acromegaly, Pick disease\u00a0and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Imaging can be combined with other diagnostic methods synergistically, improving the diagnostic potential of AI. For example, imaging analysis using AI enhances the results of AI NGS-based genetic analysis and provides a higher level of accuracy in the prediction of pathogenic genes. This approach is called PEDIA\u00a0(Prioritization of Exome Data by Image Analysis) and was tested in a large cohort of patients with monogenic rare diseases, showing significantly improved disease-causing gene prediction . Similarly, a combination of AI image analysis and brain function was used for determining if a patient with Huntington's disease (HD) will receive a clinical diagnosis within the next five years, and for assessment of oculomotor function preceding HD . Another framework, Phen-Gen, shows very promising results by combining patients\u2019 sequencing data and phenotypes for the recognition of coding and non-coding variants in rare diseases. It showed a significant 52% increased accuracy in variant prediction as compared to genotype-only analyses ML and DL have been instrumental in the development of diagnostic tools that can swiftly analyze CT scans, X-ray images, and images from other modalities to identify patterns characteristic of diseases . AI-based positron emission tomography (PET) has huge potential in the diagnosis of rare diseases as well. It has shown to have a significant role in the diagnosis and subsequent management of multiple rare diseases including multiple endocrine neoplasias, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), Von Hippel-Lindau disease, Erdheim-Chester disease, familial carcinoid syndrome and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) AI deep learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), have achieved very good results in image classification and radiomics for cholangiocarcinoma . A retrospective study tested AI analysis of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas to predict malignancy, and results revealed a very high accuracy (94%) as compared to human diagnosis (54%) ML has been shown to be highly effective in the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. ML outperforms traditional standard diagnostic approaches like high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) for detecting pulmonary involvement. ML algorithms could identify pulmonary involvement before deterioration occurs, which can improve survival rates and lower medical expenses Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging reveal similarities in brain function that suggest overlap across several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) at the intermediate phenotypic level. ML-based supervised and unsupervised analysis of biological datasets may produce predictive models for differentiating between these NDDs and aid in both the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders which include some RDs AI models utilizing a variety of different techniques to identify and classify genetic mutations in RDs have been highlighted in Tables SilVA can accurately predict the harmfulness of silent variants in Meckel syndrome and other rare diseases.AI-based models analyzed and sorted gene variants and the effect they produced into three groups - mild, intermediate and severe.363 CVID patients were genotyped, showing 610,000 SNPs, 1000 of which were strongly predictive of CVID.SpliceAI, a NN, was used to assess the impact of a pathogenic cryptic splice mutation in HOCM.

This problem is particularly apparent in the case of RDs, as there is frequently insufficient data available for model training The scarcity of data poses a significant obstacle in deep learning research for rare diseases, as highlighted in analyses of the challenges associated with employing this technology in this domain . With their abundance of omics data and small patient population, RDs pose a distinct data issue. Because orphan patients are still uncommon, ML analyses are still greatly impacted by this, even with registries. In order to support modeling efforts, open data can therefore be quite important. In the future, utilizing open data and patient registries together will be essential to extracting as much information as possible for possible insights . Additionally, the complexity of treating numerous RDs is further exacerbated by the variety of clinical presentations, therapeutic modalities used by various healthcare professionals, and variations in biological traits Several methods based on deep learning have been used in papers to solve this problem. A number of studies have concentrated on creating novel deep-learning architectures that are suited to deal with the shortage of data. Data augmentation is another frequently employed approach to address the issue of limited data, and it will be covered in more detail in overcoming limitations A key challenge is the lack of interpretability in AI models, making it difficult for researchers and physicians to understand algorithmic outputs. Explainability is still an issue of contention when it comes to using AI in healthcare. Even though AI-powered systems have outperformed humans in several analytical tasks, explainability is still lacking, which is a source of criticism. In this sense, explainable AI techniques mark the next wave of machine learning applications in the medical field, with the goal of making sure that patients and doctors alike are aware of how artificial intelligence makes decisions One significant challenge faced by supervised AI models, particularly in natural language processing, is their difficulty in distinguishing between sentences with opposite meanings that share similar wording . This phenomenon, known as\u00a0semantic ambiguity, poses a critical issue in medical AI applications, where minor variations in phrasing can lead to vastly different clinical interpretations . For example, a model might struggle to differentiate between \u2018The patient is not experiencing symptoms of infection\u2019 and \u2018The patient is now experiencing symptoms of infection,\u2019 despite their structural similarity . This limitation arises because many supervised models rely heavily on word frequency and syntactic patterns rather than deep contextual understanding . Addressing this challenge requires\u00a0context-aware AI approaches, such as transformer-based models, which utilize\u00a0attention mechanisms\u00a0to capture nuanced semantic differences . Despite these advancements, ambiguity remains a persistent issue in NLP applications for healthcare and rare disease diagnosis, as highlighted in recent literature.The sharing of incidental discoveries made by AI systems raises consent issues, especially when it comes to rare diseases. Strict regulations are necessary to prevent the misuse of AI-generated data, especially in vulnerable populations. This covers steps to guarantee the moral application of AI technology in healthcare contexts as well as patient privacy protection The application of AI in healthcare poses several ethical, legal, technological, and societal problems. Data ethics, privacy, and potential biases in AI systems are ethical issues that affect clinical decision-making and the management of patient health data. The absence of international AI laws and duties in AI healthcare applications leads to legal complications. To stop attacks on AI systems and data breaches, security precautions are crucial. The degree of societal acceptability varies; patients frequently favor medical professionals' diagnosis over those made by artificial intelligence, and healthcare workers in developing nations express concerns about their job security Scientific problems include algorithmic fairness, which involves bias, dataset shifts which include variations in the properties or distribution of data over time, and adaptation to changing healthcare practices. Resolving biases in AI systems is essential for providing healthcare in a fair manner Recent advancements have introduced solutions to data limitations, such as data augmentation. The model can be trained, and patterns can be found from a smaller dataset by using this technique, which can either modify the original data or create synthetic data. This is very useful when working with restricted data. Patterns can even be identified from complex and unlabeled data by using an unsupervised learning technique Fine-tuning, or transfer learning, involves training AI models on a large dataset (e.g., common diseases) before refining them using smaller datasets (e.g., rare diseases). For instance, the PLIER framework developed by researchers utilizes an unsupervised transfer learning framework and can be adapted to smaller datasets such as RDs and precision medicine Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that undergo peer review are crucial for promoting trust and AI adoption in medicine. It is necessary to evaluate biases and utility in clinical practice by transparent reporting of AI research and adherence to known best practices, such as the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) To summarize, the integration of AI\u00a0and ML\u00a0in the domain of RDs\u00a0provides an excellent opportunity for substantial progressions in patient care, diagnosis, and treatment. With their wide range of appearances and rarity, RDs have traditionally presented difficult challenges. However, with the integration of AI and ML with a wealth of biomedical knowledge and data, RDs are about to undergo a radical change. AI\u00a0is particularly useful in the diagnosis field since it can quickly identify rare diseases by evaluating large datasets from multiple sources. These technologies efficiently solve issues resulting from a lack of knowledge and awareness by classifying patients into illness groups, analyzing symptoms, and even using facial scans for diagnosis. AI additionally makes precision medicine achievable by using patient registry data to personalize care and follow-up according to individual genetic profiles. This improves diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and prevention while offering valuable knowledge about the well-being of the patient.However, there are challenges and constraints associated with the application of AI in healthcare that are related to legal, ethical, and technological issues like security, privacy, bias, and data ethics. It is critical to overcome these obstacles while maintaining open lines of communication and attending to concerns about data safety.\u00a0Despite these obstacles, the future of AI and ML in RDs holds great promise. As AI applications continue to advance and health databases expand, personalized, efficient, and patient-centered care is becoming increasingly achievable. AI complements human intelligence to significantly enhance the lives of individuals with RDs, ultimately reducing the burden on both patients and healthcare systems.Faster diagnosis of rare diseases with artificial intelligence-A precept of ethics, economy and quality of life [Article in German]Artificial intelligence enables comprehensive genome interpretation and nomination of candidate diagnoses for rare genetic diseasesImproving early diagnosis of rare diseases using Natural Language Processing in unstructured medical records: an illustration from Dravet syndromeValidation of an artificial intelligence driven framework to automatically detect red flag symptoms in screening for rare diseases in electronic health records: hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis polyneuropathy as a key exampleAn artificial intelligence-based approach for identifying rare disease patients using retrospective electronic health records applied for Pompe diseaseArtificial intelligence in medical imaging and its impact on the rare disease community: threats, challenges and opportunitiesKBG syndrome: videoconferencing and use of artificial intelligence driven facial phenotyping in 25 new patientsThe impact of artificial intelligence on optimizing diagnosis and treatment plans for rare genetic disordersIn silico prediction of the effects of mutations in the human mevalonate kinase gene: towards a predictive framework for mevalonate kinase deficiencyConstructing a database for the relations between CNV and human genetic diseases via systematic text miningPlease note that by doing so you agree to be added to our monthly email newsletter distribution list.Cureus personal data will never be sold to third parties and will only be used to enrich the user experience and contact you in direct relation to the application.

(February 22, 2025) Artificial Intelligence: A New Frontier in Rare Disease Early Diagnosis. Cureus 17(2): e79487. doi:10.7759/cureus.79487\nRare diseases present significant challenges, including delays in diagnosis, inadequate treatment responses, and difficulties in monitoring. These challenges arise from the complexity of symptoms, limited medical expertise, and insufficient diagnostic tools. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained attention for its potential to improve healthcare, particularly in diagnosing complex conditions. By analyzing large datasets, recognizing patterns, and integrating clinical information, AI can refine diagnostic accuracy, enhance treatment strategies, and improve patient outcomes.This literature review examines AI applications in\u00a0three key areas of rare disease diagnosis:\u00a0genetic analysis, imaging-based phenotyping, and natural language processing (NLP) for clinical data extraction.\u00a0AI-driven advancements in these domains have been explored to improve disease detection and management. However, several challenges persist, including limited data availability, algorithm transparency, privacy considerations, and ethical concerns. Efforts such as data augmentation and transfer learning are being explored to address these issues and expand AI\u2019s role in clinical practice.By refining diagnostic processes and optimizing treatment strategies, AI has the potential to improve the management of rare diseases. This review critically examines AI's role in rare disease diagnosis, with a particular emphasis on its applications in\u00a0genetic analysis, imaging-based phenotyping, and NLP, while also addressing key challenges and future directions for clinical integration.More than 350 million people worldwide are afflicted by more than 7,000 rare diseases (RDs), each of which affects a comparatively small number of patients. However, obtaining a timely and accurate diagnosis remains a significant challenge. Patients with rare disorders typically search for a proper diagnosis for six years after their symptoms first appear . According to a 2013 survey, patients with uncommon diseases often must wait an average of more than five years, seeing eight different doctors and going through two to three misdiagnoses before a proper diagnosis is made . Moreover, RDs are difficult for physicians to diagnose quickly because of their complexity, unpredictability, lack of specific symptoms, and general lack of knowledge about such conditions These challenges arise due to the low prevalence of specific rare diseases, a scarcity of experts, limited accessibility to specialists, and inadequate infrastructure and funding for RD research. The use of computer-based support to enhance clinical workflows is an emerging technology, especially in the fields of AI and machine learning (ML), to overcome these challenges . Furthermore, ML methods have been applied to phenotyping and drug discovery, as well as a number of healthcare domains, such as disease diagnosis, prediction of disease onset, mortality, and length of hospital stay. Consequently, using deep learning (DL) to solve the complexity related to rare diseases has garnered a lot of interest AI refers to the capability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, including learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Numerous AI algorithms provide noteworthy advantages in supporting the diagnosis of RDs\u00a0and non-RDs. A branch of AI called ML\u00a0allows machines to learn from their experiences and become more efficient without the need for explicit programming. Through three main types of algorithms, ML\u00a0plays a critical role in diagnosis: (a) unsupervised, which recognizes patterns; (b) supervised, which classifies or predicts based on prior examples; and (c) reinforcement learning, which uses reward and punishment processes to generate strategies for overcoming particular obstacles. A subset of ML techniques called DL\u00a0is focused on picture recognition. By breaking down complex mappings into groups of simpler ones, DL allows for more effective analysis . Finally, a large amount of the human variability and bias inherent in translating data from medical records can be eliminated by using natural language processing (NLP), a branch of AI that focuses on understanding human language While AI has been broadly applied to various areas of healthcare, this review specifically focuses on three critical applications of AI in rare disease diagnosis: (1) genetic analysis, (2) imaging-based phenotyping, and (3) natural language processing (NLP) for clinical data extraction.\u00a0These areas were chosen because they represent the most promising and actively researched AI-driven approaches for addressing the challenges of rare disease diagnosis.Given AI's growing role in rare disease diagnosis, this review seeks to answer the following question: How has AI contributed to early and accurate rare disease diagnosis, and what challenges must be overcome for its broader clinical adoption? To address this question, the review examines AI applications in these three domains:1. Genetic Analysis:\u00a0Many rare diseases have a genetic basis, and AI-driven approaches have been developed to enhance the interpretation of genomic data, identify pathogenic variants, and improve diagnostic accuracy.2. Imaging-Based Phenotyping:\u00a0AI, particularly deep learning, has shown significant promise in identifying disease-associated patterns in medical imaging, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of rare diseases.3. NLP:\u00a0AI-powered NLP techniques can extract meaningful insights from unstructured clinical data, including physician notes and electronic health records, to support the identification of rare diseases that might otherwise be missed.By systematically analyzing AI\u2019s contributions, current limitations, and future research directions in these three domains, this review provides a structured evaluation of AI\u2019s role in rare disease diagnosis and explores the necessary steps for its broader clinical adoption.\u00a0illustrates the various applications of AI and ML in problem-solving and decision-making processes.To diagnose RDs, first-generation AI focuses on making clinical choices by evaluating large datasets. However, one of the biggest obstacles facing RDs is the lack of initial data inputs. On the other hand, second-generation AI looks for clinical hints that are frequently missed in the initial phases of RD detection. This approach efficiently supports early diagnosis, enabling intervention and prevention for a range of RDs. For example, ML has been used recently to identify individuals with systemic sclerosis who are at a high risk of serious consequences and to identify organ involvement early AI and ML are currently being used in healthcare settings to improve medical image processing, forecast and prevent illnesses, and optimize hospital operations. Healthcare professionals can diagnose and treat patients more accurately and efficiently by utilizing these technologies. Moreover, doctors may be able to diagnose, treat, and manage patients more quickly with the help of AI and ML, which would eventually improve patient outcomes This article explores the innovative potential of AI in aiding healthcare professionals to identify patients promptly and accurately with rare diseases, consequently, lessening the time required for diagnosis and thus enhancing their chances of receiving timely medical attention.This review was conducted by manually collecting relevant literature from multiple databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, UpToDate, and Google Scholar, covering studies published between January 2013 and January 2025.

This qualitative synthesis provides an overview of AI\u2019s impact on rare disease diagnostics across genetic, imaging, and NLP-based approaches.A general assessment of potential biases in the included studies was conducted based on key methodological factors such as selection criteria, study design, data sources, and funding disclosures. While no formal risk of bias tool was applied, considerations were made regarding potential limitations that could influence the findings.Overall, some studies exhibited limitations related to sample size, potential conflicts of interest, and selective reporting. However, efforts were made to include peer-reviewed studies and reputable sources to enhance the credibility of this review. Future research should aim to adopt more standardized methodologies to minimize bias and improve reproducibility.AI has emerged as a powerful tool in rare disease diagnosis, integrating diverse data sources to enhance accuracy and early detection . It is currently regularly employed, and a part of diagnostic workups in highly specialized centers for the diagnosis and management of diseases in oncology, rheumatology, and genetics . Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in the application of these technologies and methods to aid in the diagnosis of rare diseases.Since 80% of rare diseases in literature have an underlying genetic cause, the application of AI has proved to be quite useful . Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the process of sorting through millions of DNA sequences, which when combined with AI can help in the detection of genetic anomalies . AI algorithms play an important role in enhancing and automating various aspects of NGS data analysis, leading to increased precision and efficiency. One of the most important applications of AI in NGS data analysis is to align the sequences to a reference genome which is crucial for the detection of gene variations and mutations. AI excels in this task and facilitates the development of novel tools for NGS data interpretation Many different tools have been developed using NGS to aid in the diagnosis of Mendelian diseases. PhenIX is one such tool which integrates genetic analysis with phenotypic appearance. It reads the patient's genotype, finds any genetic variants and then prioritizes these based on the phenotypic appearance of the patient. Another tool, Xrare does the same . In addition to this, these tools can predict the pathogenicity of genes, discover molecular markers, and create predictive models based on gene expression data. AI can quickly scan and sort through large genetic datasets, which is not possible by humans A study assessed Fabric GEM (Fabric Genomics, Oakland, CA, USA), a new AI-based tool for hastening genome interpretation (whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES)), on a retrospective cohort of 119 patients diagnosed with rare genetic diseases in addition to a separate cohort of 60 cases from different academic centers. GEM identified over 90% of the causative genes as the top or second candidate and identified the causative structural variant (SV) as the top candidate in 17 of 20 patients with diagnostic SVs AI, especially ML, has also been applied to the field of epigenetics. Epigenetic modifications have been identified in many rare diseases including Rett syndrome, hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type 1E, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome The increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) globally is advancing data mining in healthcare. Data from EHRs can be structured (as in constrained choices via drop-down menus, check boxes, and pre-filled templates) and unstructured (as in free text narratives/notes used by healthcare professionals) This is a promising field where data from these sources can be used to develop models to support early diagnosis. NLP\u00a0is a subset of AI which is concerned with understanding, analyzing, and interpreting the human language . NLP technology can be used along with Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to convert health providers\u2019 notes and narratives into structured, standardized formats, which can then further be interpreted for establishing natural history and assisting in early diagnosis of a variety of diseases, including rare diseases . This approach is based on the premise that these data capture unique insights from experienced physicians, which might otherwise be overlooked in formal measurements or purely biological assessments A study conducted used NLP and UMLS to study a cohort of Dravet syndrome (DS) which presents with the onset of epileptic encephalopathy in the first year of life, characterized by febrile seizures and convulsive status epilepticus, and a cohort of febrile seizures not linked to an underlying disorder. The results showed the presence of certain keywords and concepts specific to DS diagnosis in the medical records which were automatically detected by the software using NLP. This approach represents a new methodology that can help flag such symptoms and decrease the time to diagnose DS and could also be extrapolated to other rare diseases Another study validated a novel, state-of-the-art NLP algorithm for the detection of red flag symptoms of multisystemic hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) polyneuropathy from EHRs, in a retrospective sample of 1015 patients. The accuracy of the algorithm was compared with a manual standard on a random sample of 300 patients. There was high accuracy in the detection of red flag symptoms, which showed F1 scores between 0.88 and 0.98. There was a relative increase of 48.6% in genetic testing, which has implications for earlier detection of patients with a rare disease AI has been used for retrospective screening of over 300,000 unstructured EHRs for flagging patients for Pompe\u2019s disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS-II). The algorithms had a specificity of 18.27% for Pompe\u2019s disease, which is crucial as it is a progressive but treatable debilitating neuromuscular disease . DL\u00a0is a subset of ML\u00a0which is involved in image processing. DL algorithms can break down complex imaging mappings into simpler mappings which allows for highly efficient analysis. The algorithm then uses these simpler mappings to read the image and derive important information from it. DL provides superior recognition and can process large amounts of data in a very short time, which can aid in a swift and accurate diagnosis. AI has been shown to have a higher flexibility and scalability as compared to traditional biometrics, which has contributed to early detection, superior efficiency and understanding of complex relationships DeepGestalt (FDNA, Atlanta, GA, USA) is one such deep-learning facial analysis framework used for the classification of genetic diseases. DeepGestalt has been applied in multiple studies for rare disease diagnosis, demonstrating moderate to high accuracy. These diseases include Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Emanuel syndrome, and Pallister-Killian syndrome. It can differentiate between 200 RDs and is able to achieve 91% accuracy in getting the correct diagnosis in the top 10 results . In one study, DeepGestalt was applied for the analysis of facial phenotypes of 25 individuals with KBG syndrome. KBG syndrome was identified as the first (most probable) diagnosis in 28% of patients, second in 40%, and third or fourth for 12%. Overall, KBG syndrome was identified as a potential diagnosis as the top five differentials in 80% of individuals Face2Gene (FDNA, Atlanta, GA, USA) is another software that uses DL to analyze facial photographs and help in the diagnosis of rare diseases . Other algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been used in the diagnosis of rare diseases like acromegaly, Pick disease\u00a0and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Imaging can be combined with other diagnostic methods synergistically, improving the diagnostic potential of AI. For example, imaging analysis using AI enhances the results of AI NGS-based genetic analysis and provides a higher level of accuracy in the prediction of pathogenic genes. This approach is called PEDIA\u00a0(Prioritization of Exome Data by Image Analysis) and was tested in a large cohort of patients with monogenic rare diseases, showing significantly improved disease-causing gene prediction . Similarly, a combination of AI image analysis and brain function was used for determining if a patient with Huntington's disease (HD) will receive a clinical diagnosis within the next five years, and for assessment of oculomotor function preceding HD . Another framework, Phen-Gen, shows very promising results by combining patients\u2019 sequencing data and phenotypes for the recognition of coding and non-coding variants in rare diseases. It showed a significant 52% increased accuracy in variant prediction as compared to genotype-only analyses ML and DL have been instrumental in the development of diagnostic tools that can swiftly analyze CT scans, X-ray images, and images from other modalities to identify patterns characteristic of diseases . AI-based positron emission tomography (PET) has huge potential in the diagnosis of rare diseases as well. It has shown to have a significant role in the diagnosis and subsequent management of multiple rare diseases including multiple endocrine neoplasias, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), Von Hippel-Lindau disease, Erdheim-Chester disease, familial carcinoid syndrome and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) AI deep learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), have achieved very good results in image classification and radiomics for cholangiocarcinoma . A retrospective study tested AI analysis of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas to predict malignancy, and results revealed a very high accuracy (94%) as compared to human diagnosis (54%) ML has been shown to be highly effective in the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. ML outperforms traditional standard diagnostic approaches like high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) for detecting pulmonary involvement. ML algorithms could identify pulmonary involvement before deterioration occurs, which can improve survival rates and lower medical expenses Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging reveal similarities in brain function that suggest overlap across several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) at the intermediate phenotypic level. ML-based supervised and unsupervised analysis of biological datasets may produce predictive models for differentiating between these NDDs and aid in both the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders which include some RDs AI models utilizing a variety of different techniques to identify and classify genetic mutations in RDs have been highlighted in Tables SilVA can accurately predict the harmfulness of silent variants in Meckel syndrome and other rare diseases.AI-based models analyzed and sorted gene variants and the effect they produced into three groups - mild, intermediate and severe.363 CVID patients were genotyped, showing 610,000 SNPs, 1000 of which were strongly predictive of CVID.SpliceAI, a NN, was used to assess the impact of a pathogenic cryptic splice mutation in HOCM. The analysis of such mutations opens a new avenue for the diagnosis of RDs.VarCoPP uses ML and was trained using known rare oligogenic diseases and had high confidence labels of 95% and 99%.DNorm, an AI ML-powered tool, to generate CNVdigest, which contains 1582 CNVs and 2425 diseases. CNVdigest identifies CNV-disease associations and has shown results with DiGeorge syndrome.An AI tool eDiVA was applied to rare diseases like CF, PKU among others. It was able to identify known causal variants with high precision and recall.\n1: Overview of AI/ML-Based Genetic Diagnostic Tools and Their Applications in Rare Disease Research\nVEST:\u00a0Variant Effect Scoring Tool;\u00a0SilVA:\u00a0Silent Variant Analyzer Tool;\u00a0SNAP:\u00a0Screening\u00a0for Non-Acceptable Polymorphisms Tool; PennCNV:\u00a0A model for detecting copy number variations\u00a0in whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms data;\u00a0SpliceAI:\u00a0Deep neural network tool for predicting splicing from pre-mRNA sequences;\u00a0VarCoPP:\u00a0Variant Combinations Pathogenicity Predictor Tool; CNVdigest: A web tool that uses text mining to link copy number variations\u00a0with genetic diseases;\u00a0eDIVA:\u00a0Exome Disease Variant Analysis Tool;\u00a0CF:\u00a0Cystic Fibrosis;\u00a0PKU:\u00a0Phenylketonuria;\u00a0HOCM:\u00a0Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy;\u00a0CVID: Common Variable Immunodeficiency;\u00a0ML:\u00a0Machine Learning;\u00a0AI:\u00a0Artificial Intelligence;\u00a0CNV:\u00a0Copy Number Variation;\u00a0SNPs:\u00a0Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms;\u00a0RDs:\u00a0Rare DiseasesROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve):\u00a0Measures how well the AI model distinguishes between disease-causing and benign variants.\u00a0AUC = 1.0 is perfect, while 0.5 is random chance.Accuracy (%):\u00a0Proportion of correctly classified cases, including disease-causing and benign variants.F1 Score:\u00a0A balance between\u00a0precision (correct positive predictions)\u00a0and\u00a0recall (ability to detect all actual cases).\u00a0Higher values indicate\u00a0better model performance, especially for rare diseases.Sensitivity (%):\u00a0The ability to correctly detect true positive cases (e.g., AI-based PET imaging detects >95% of rare metabolic cancers).Top-N Diagnosis Accuracy:\u00a0The percentage of times the correct diagnosis appears in the top\u00a0N\u00a0results (e.g., DeepGestalt correctly includes the diagnosis\u00a091% of the time in its top 10 suggestions).AI models have inherent limitations, particularly those requiring large, high-quality datasets for optimal performance. This problem is particularly apparent in the case of RDs, as there is frequently insufficient data available for model training The scarcity of data poses a significant obstacle in deep learning research for rare diseases, as highlighted in analyses of the challenges associated with employing this technology in this domain . With their abundance of omics data and small patient population, RDs pose a distinct data issue. Because orphan patients are still uncommon, ML analyses are still greatly impacted by this, even with registries. In order to support modeling efforts, open data can therefore be quite important. In the future, utilizing open data and patient registries together will be essential to extracting as much information as possible for possible insights . Additionally, the complexity of treating numerous RDs is further exacerbated by the variety of clinical presentations, therapeutic modalities used by various healthcare professionals, and variations in biological traits Several methods based on deep learning have been used in papers to solve this problem. A number of studies have concentrated on creating novel deep-learning architectures that are suited to deal with the shortage of data. Data augmentation is another frequently employed approach to address the issue of limited data, and it will be covered in more detail in overcoming limitations A key challenge is the lack of interpretability in AI models, making it difficult for researchers and physicians to understand algorithmic outputs. Explainability is still an issue of contention when it comes to using AI in healthcare. Even though AI-powered systems have outperformed humans in several analytical tasks, explainability is still lacking, which is a source of criticism. In this sense, explainable AI techniques mark the next wave of machine learning applications in the medical field, with the goal of making sure that patients and doctors alike are aware of how artificial intelligence makes decisions One significant challenge faced by supervised AI models, particularly in natural language processing, is their difficulty in distinguishing between sentences with opposite meanings that share similar wording . This phenomenon, known as\u00a0semantic ambiguity, poses a critical issue in medical AI applications, where minor variations in phrasing can lead to vastly different clinical interpretations . For example, a model might struggle to differentiate between \u2018The patient is not experiencing symptoms of infection\u2019 and \u2018The patient is now experiencing symptoms of infection,\u2019 despite their structural similarity . This limitation arises because many supervised models rely heavily on word frequency and syntactic patterns rather than deep contextual understanding . Addressing this challenge requires\u00a0context-aware AI approaches, such as transformer-based models, which utilize\u00a0attention mechanisms\u00a0to capture nuanced semantic differences . Despite these advancements, ambiguity remains a persistent issue in NLP applications for healthcare and rare disease diagnosis, as highlighted in recent literature.The sharing of incidental discoveries made by AI systems raises consent issues, especially when it comes to rare diseases. Strict regulations are necessary to prevent the misuse of AI-generated data, especially in vulnerable populations. This covers steps to guarantee the moral application of AI technology in healthcare contexts as well as patient privacy protection The application of AI in healthcare poses several ethical, legal, technological, and societal problems. Data ethics, privacy, and potential biases in AI systems are ethical issues that affect clinical decision-making and the management of patient health data. The absence of international AI laws and duties in AI healthcare applications leads to legal complications. To stop attacks on AI systems and data breaches, security precautions are crucial. The degree of societal acceptability varies; patients frequently favor medical professionals' diagnosis over those made by artificial intelligence, and healthcare workers in developing nations express concerns about their job security Scientific problems include algorithmic fairness, which involves bias, dataset shifts which include variations in the properties or distribution of data over time, and adaptation to changing healthcare practices. Resolving biases in AI systems is essential for providing healthcare in a fair manner Recent advancements have introduced solutions to data limitations, such as data augmentation. The model can be trained, and patterns can be found from a smaller dataset by using this technique, which can either modify the original data or create synthetic data. This is very useful when working with restricted data. Patterns can even be identified from complex and unlabeled data by using an unsupervised learning technique Fine-tuning, or transfer learning, involves training AI models on a large dataset (e.g., common diseases) before refining them using smaller datasets (e.g., rare diseases). For instance, the PLIER framework developed by researchers utilizes an unsupervised transfer learning framework and can be adapted to smaller datasets such as RDs and precision medicine Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that undergo peer review are crucial for promoting trust and AI adoption in medicine. It is necessary to evaluate biases and utility in clinical practice by transparent reporting of AI research and adherence to known best practices, such as the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) To summarize, the integration of AI\u00a0and ML\u00a0in the domain of RDs\u00a0provides an excellent opportunity for substantial progressions in patient care, diagnosis, and treatment. With their wide range of appearances and rarity, RDs have traditionally presented difficult challenges. However, with the integration of AI and ML with a wealth of biomedical knowledge and data, RDs are about to undergo a radical change. AI\u00a0is particularly useful in the diagnosis field since it can quickly identify rare diseases by evaluating large datasets from multiple sources. These technologies efficiently solve issues resulting from a lack of knowledge and awareness by classifying patients into illness groups, analyzing symptoms, and even using facial scans for diagnosis. AI additionally makes precision medicine achievable by using patient registry data to personalize care and follow-up according to individual genetic profiles. This improves diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and prevention while offering valuable knowledge about the well-being of the patient.However, there are challenges and constraints associated with the application of AI in healthcare that are related to legal, ethical, and technological issues like security, privacy, bias, and data ethics. It is critical to overcome these obstacles while maintaining open lines of communication and attending to concerns about data safety.\u00a0Despite these obstacles, the future of AI and ML in RDs holds great promise. As AI applications continue to advance and health databases expand, personalized, efficient, and patient-centered care is becoming increasingly achievable. AI complements human intelligence to significantly enhance the lives of individuals with RDs, ultimately reducing the burden on both patients and healthcare systems.Faster diagnosis of rare diseases with artificial intelligence-A precept of ethics, economy and quality of life [Article in German]Artificial intelligence enables comprehensive genome interpretation and nomination of candidate diagnoses for rare genetic diseasesImproving early diagnosis of rare diseases using Natural Language Processing in unstructured medical records: an illustration from Dravet syndromeValidation of an artificial intelligence driven framework to automatically detect red flag symptoms in screening for rare diseases in electronic health records: hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis polyneuropathy as a key exampleAn artificial intelligence-based approach for identifying rare disease patients using retrospective electronic health records applied for Pompe diseaseArtificial intelligence in medical imaging and its impact on the rare disease community: threats, challenges and opportunitiesKBG syndrome: videoconferencing and use of artificial intelligence driven facial phenotyping in 25 new patientsThe impact of artificial intelligence on optimizing diagnosis and treatment plans for rare genetic disordersIn silico prediction of the effects of mutations in the human mevalonate kinase gene: towards a predictive framework for mevalonate kinase deficiencyConstructing a database for the relations between CNV and human genetic diseases via systematic text miningPlease note that by doing so you agree to be added to our monthly email newsletter distribution list.Cureus personal data will never be sold to third parties and will only be used to enrich the user experience and contact you in direct relation to the application.

From streamlining administrative tasks to assisting in life-saving diagnoses, AI is making medicine faster, more efficient, and more reliable. But as AI takes on a greater role in healthcare, many wonder: Can we trust AI-driven decisions? And how does it ensure both speed and accuracy without compromising patient care?One of the biggest challenges in healthcare today is the overwhelming administrative workload. Doctors, nurses, and hospital staff spend countless hours on paperwork, insurance claims, and data entry, which takes time away from patient care. AI-powered automation is changing this by handling routine tasks more efficiently.For example, AI-driven electronic health record (EHR) systems help medical professionals quickly retrieve patient histories, reducing the time spent searching for records. AI also automates appointment scheduling, billing, and insurance verification, cutting down administrative burdens and allowing healthcare workers to focus on what truly matters\u2014patient health.Beyond administrative tasks, AI is revolutionizing how doctors diagnose diseases and recommend treatments. AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of medical data\u2014scans, lab results, and patient histories\u2014to detect patterns that may not be obvious to the human eye.One notable application is in medical imaging. AI-powered tools assist radiologists in identifying tumors, fractures, or abnormalities in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with remarkable accuracy. In some cases, AI can detect early signs of diseases like cancer before a human doctor might, leading to faster interventions and better patient outcomes.Similarly, AI-driven predictive analytics help doctors foresee potential health issues before they become critical. For example, AI can analyze a patient\u2019s risk factors and alert doctors to the likelihood of heart disease, diabetes, or stroke, enabling preventive care rather than reactive treatment.While AI enhances efficiency and accuracy, it\u2019s crucial to maintain human oversight in healthcare. Trusting AI blindly without understanding how it makes decisions can be risky, especially in high-stakes situations.One way to build trust in AI is through explainable AI (XAI). Unlike \u201cblack box\u201d AI models, which offer results without transparency, XAI provides a clear breakdown of how it reaches conclusions. This is particularly important in healthcare, where doctors and patients need to understand the reasoning behind an AI-generated diagnosis or treatment plan. For example, if an AI system recommends a specific cancer treatment, it should provide a detailed explanation based on medical history, lab results, and clinical research. This ensures doctors can validate AI-driven recommendations before implementing them.Medical errors are a major concern in healthcare, sometimes resulting in serious consequences for patients. AI can significantly reduce human errors by offering decision support to healthcare providers.For instance, AI can cross-check prescriptions and alert doctors if a patient\u2019s medication might cause harmful interactions. AI-powered monitoring systems in hospitals track patient vitals in real-time, detecting early signs of complications and notifying healthcare teams before conditions worsen.Robotic process automation (RPA) is also playing a role in preventing errors. By automating repetitive tasks such as data entry and lab result processing, RPA reduces the risk of mistakes that might occur due to human fatigue or oversight.AI\u2019s role in healthcare is only expected to grow. Innovations like AI-powered chatbots are already helping patients get quick answers to medical questions, schedule appointments, and access basic healthcare advice. Wearable devices equipped with AI analyze real-time health data, alerting users and doctors to potential issues before they become emergencies.However, ethical concerns remain. Ensuring AI respects patient privacy, avoids biases, and provides reliable recommendations will be key to its continued success. AI should not replace human doctors but rather serve as a powerful tool to support them, making healthcare more efficient, accessible, and safe.AI is revolutionizing healthcare by making it faster, more reliable, and more efficient. From reducing administrative burdens to improving diagnoses and preventing medical errors, AI is transforming how medicine is practiced. However, balancing AI\u2019s speed with human oversight is essential to ensuring trust and accuracy. As AI continues to evolve, its potential to enhance patient care and save lives will only expand.Dr. Fazal Panezai Grant for Healthcare Students Encourages Future Medical Leaders to Shape the Future of Patient CarePEPE Price Prediction, PEPE To Hit $100B Market Cap Late 2025, Lightchain AI Could Be The Better 5000% BetMeme coins have transformed the crypto space, turning jokes into multi-million-dollar investments overnight.

(February 23, 2025) Integrating Ethical Principles Into the Regulation of AI-Driven Medical Software. Cureus 17(2): e79506. doi:10.7759/cureus.79506\nIn recent years, a sharp increase in artificial intelligence (AI)-based software as medical devices has been seen in the United States and the European Union. Despite the huge potential of these devices in alleviating suffering through rapid identification and early intervention, their adoption in clinical practice has remained relatively slow due to ethical questions surrounding their usage. Even though there is no universal framework for the approval of these devices, the guiding principles behind individual regulatory bodies almost stay the same, with some more focused on the technical aspect while others involving the ethical aspects as well. The International Medical Device Regulators Forum devised a SaMD Working Group to outline the essential controls guiding the approval of these devices, but there is a lack of a structured approach for the regulatory approval process. This article outlines the principles of medical ethics, such as autonomy, beneficence, and fair distribution of healthcare sources, and how they relate to the use of AI-based devices. The core regulatory guidelines are then viewed in light of these ethical principles. We recommend that a comprehensive regulatory framework with integration of principles of medical ethics be made public. Though no universally accepted framework is available, regulating quality management, risk assessment, and data privacy would help build trust to promote the adoption of AI in healthcare.The domain of medical ethics is as old as the field of medicine itself and is under continuous evolution. A significant milestone in the field of ethics was achieved in 1803 when British physician Thomas Percival published his work \u201cMedical Ethics,\u201d thus formally coining the term  and changed the way of looking at medical ethics from the Hippocratic paternalism lens to a more suitable approach encompassing autonomy, beneficence, consent, and non-maleficence . The experts are actively engaged in exploring the ethical implications of new emerging technologies and developing guidelines to ensure their ethical and responsible implementations With the rapid ongoing digital transformation of every field of life, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine brings forth a whole new set of ethical challenges that need to be addressed . Although this confluence of two highly advanced disciplines has the potential to revolutionize medical practice and enhance the efficiency of healthcare systems , it has also raised ethical concerns regarding the use of AI-based devices in clinical settings. Explainability and transparency of AI algorithms are the characteristics that are crucial to ensuring the trust and accountability of these systems. Ethical frameworks are often taken as guiding principles to assess the ethical challenges associated with AI in medicine , but a more structured regulatory framework integrating the ethical component is essential to ensure patient safety.The world saw a rapid development of AI-based systems in various disciplines, ranging from agriculture to finance, in recent years. \u201cSoftware as a medical device\u201d or SaMD is one of the emerging AI-based products that has a lot of ethical concerns associated with their use but a less structured approval pathway to address them . There are multiple definitions of SaMD, but the \u201cInternational Medical Device Regulators Forum\u201d defines it as \u201csoftware intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device\u201d . John McCarthy, who coined the term AI in 1955, defined it as \u201cthe science and engineering of making intelligent machines\u201d . Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that makes computer systems capable of learning without being explicitly programmed by the use of algorithms trained on specific data . Deep learning is a subset of ML that employs the power of artificial neural networks containing multiple layers to learn and make predictions about highly complex data . SaMD employs the power of these AI algorithms to serve a vast variety of diagnostic and predictive functions.Due to being an emerging discipline, the current research focus is mainly on the development of a universal and well-accepted regulatory framework that somewhat overlooks the ethical aspects related to SaMD use. The rapid approval rate of low-risk SaMD can further turn a blind eye to this aspect and can compromise it . In this article, we aim to explore what ethical concerns SaMD raises and if the existing regulatory approval process sufficiently addresses those issues. The regulatory controls, as proposed by the working group of the International Medical Device Regulation Forum, are taken as references to evaluate if they help in addressing various ethical issues of SaMD With the use of AI-enabled models, the concerns about ethical principles increase such as the use of AI in patients adversely affected with psychiatric disorders might not be in their benefit because these patients need human-human interaction and compassion. Similarly, the model used by IBM Watson to assess the information and medical data of cancer patients was criticized due to unsafe recommendations for cancer treatment, though no unsafe recommended treatment was given to real patients\u00a0. The algorithms trained on biased data also raise concerns regarding decisions made using that data on different populations . In healthcare, the doctor-patient relationship is based on empathy and sympathy. Though AI in healthcare is advancing, AI applications or robots will have difficulty in developing empathy behaviour towards patients, and patients might not have appropriate behaviour when dealing with robot physicians Using PubMed and Scopus databases, all articles related to AI and medical ethics were reviewed. Among the keywords used to search the database were \u201cSaMD\u201d, \u201cSoftware Medical Devices Regulations\u201d, \u201cRegulatory approval\u201d, \u201cMedical ethics\u201d, and \u201cbioethics\u201d. Since this is a narrative review, no statistical methods were used. Also, no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria were implemented.AI\u2019s potential to significantly impact various disciplines gave rise to a call for action for the development of guidelines for its usage . The potential of AI-based devices on human jobs is an area of concern where many fear that AI and automation can bring about significant advancement leading to job displacement for human workers  are areas of huge debate. A framework of principles of medical ethics as proposed by Beauchamp and Childress can be used in the ethical analysis of AI-based systems and guide ethical decision-making. Different national and international organizations are continuously working on the development of ethics guidelines for AI to address these concerns . In the subsequent section, the ethical issues arising from the use of SaMD are discussed, with a focus on a more traditional ethical framework consisting of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice (Figure The principle of autonomy gives patients the right to make decisions about their healthcare and expects that they should be respected. It puts special emphasis on the importance of informed consent, self-determination, and the right to refuse or accept treatment . The ethics guidelines from different organizations include various terms that fall into the domain of autonomy, such as freedom of expression, empowerment, positive freedom, freedom to flourish, freedom to withdraw consent, and freedom from manipulation and technological experimentation . All these terms serve the same purpose - to give the patient full control over the decision-making process about his health. Autonomy recognizes that individuals have unique values, beliefs, and preferences that guide their healthcare decisions and that they must be respected. SaMDs may interfere with the principle of autonomy due to their inherently complex algorithms for the decision-making process. These complex algorithms may generate predictions that are difficult to understand and can limit patients\u2019 ability to make fully informed decisions about their health. The heavy reliance of healthcare providers on the output of AI-based systems can also undermine patient autonomy as patients might feel obliged to comply with the recommendations of technology while ignoring their preferences . The notion of patient privacy and confidentiality also falls in this domain. For data-hungry ML and deep-learning algorithms, a vast amount of medical data is required for training purposes. The question of informed consent and data ownership is a complex one and varies with region. The European General Data Privacy Protection Law gives users data ownership, and users can decide how their data can be used; however, rules are different in the United States regarding data ownership  and are two fundamental principles of medical ethics that are complementary to each other (\u201cdo good and do not harm\u201d). Beneficence obliges the physician to act only for the benefit of the patient and avoid anything that could oppose the patient\u2019s well-being . The principle of non-maleficence encompasses a whole set of rules that prevents physicians from harming patients in any capacity in any way . Non-maleficence is also a principle of social justice as it aligns with broader societal concerns of fairness, equity, and well-being of vulnerable populations . AI-powered clinical decision support systems can analyze large amounts of patient data to provide more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans to healthcare providers. They comply with the principle of beneficence as they improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the healthcare system and contribute to better patient outcomes . This principle can also be seen in action in the use of AI in predictive analytics for screening patients at risk of developing a specific health condition. By identifying patterns and risk factors in patient data that would otherwise be unrecognizable by physicians, these AI-based devices lead to timely intervention and preventive measures Non-maleficence prevents any negative outcomes that can arise from the use of AI-based systems. This principle calls for the need to address the issues of bias, privacy breaches, lack of transparency of AI algorithms, and discrimination . It is interesting to know that nonmaleficence is addressed more in literature than its counterpart beneficence, which indicates the priority of AI researchers to avoid harm at all costs Justice in medical ethics refers to a fair distribution of healthcare resources and opportunities and involves the provision of services to individuals fairly and equitably . The term \u201cjustice\u201d in the context of AI refers to fairness, diversity, equality, inclusion, accessibility, elimination of bias and discrimination, and the right to appeal decisions . Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that no implicit bias arises from the use of AI-based devices and that unfair discrimination is eliminated during the development process . When AI algorithms are trained on biased datasets, they can perpetuate and even amplify existing biases, leading to discriminatory and unfair outcomes. An example of such discrimination was revealed in a study by Obermeyer et al., in which an AI algorithm to allocate healthcare resources was found to be discriminatory against African American patients. He explained that the bias exists in these algorithms because these algorithms are more focused on healthcare costs rather than the illnesses with which patients present . Topol gives many examples of data bias, including datasets used in dermatology to diagnose melanoma without including skin color, and using genomic data compiled in the United States where minorities are underrepresented. Therefore, excluding minorities from the data sets leads to prejudice in the AL algorithms . Such incidents can be avoided by employing a robust and carefully planned data collection process. By ensuring that datasets used for training AI algorithms are diverse and represent the diversity of the population they aim to serve, the risk of algorithmic bias can be mitigated . The AI ethics guidelines suggest multiple measures to promote justice, ranging from the development of technical solutions to strengthening government oversight . Regulatory bodies around the world have their own guidelines to regulate SaMD, which takes their root from existing frameworks for medical device approval. In the United States, the FDA is the main organization responsible for evaluating and approving SaMD intended for diagnostic, treatment, and preventive purposes . Challenges remain in the approval and regulation process of SaMD due to the rapidly evolving nature of AI algorithms, and a distinct and more structured regulatory framework is required to eliminate the risk of racial disparities and bias that can be caused by these . In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulates the SaMD according to the risk level and has a regulatory framework in action for AI and ML-based medical devices . Canada and Australia have their own regulatory authorities, i.e., Health Canada and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), respectively, which ensure that SaMD meets the specified safety, effectiveness, and performance level, and this evaluation mainly includes assessment at various levels, ranging from data integrity and security to clinical trials and ongoing monitoring . The regulatory framework for SaMD needs to be adaptive and prioritize patient safety and effectiveness . There is growing recognition of the need to address health disparities outcomes in AI-based SaMD. Auditing SaMD for biased output to assess equitable outcomes across populations is a good measure to promote health equity . Regulators often require comprehensive evidence and documentation for the assessment of SaMD, and there is a need for a system view focused on risk monitoring for these devices . The subsequent sections discuss aspects of the regulatory requirements as prepared by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) SaMD Working Group and relate them to relevant ethical issues.IMDRF defines three principles of an effective quality management system for SaMD: first, an organizational structure ensuring the safety, performance, and effectiveness of SaMD; second, lifecycle support processes that include product planning, risk management, patient safety, record control, and analysis and improvement of product; and, third, realization and use processes that are commonly used in software engineering lifecycle . These quality management approaches align with internationally accepted standards of ISO 13485:2016 . These principles warrant the establishment of an organizational structure that provides appropriate leadership guidance for the development, evaluation, and regulation of SaMD and also guides manufacturers to establish processes and procedures for reliable SaMD applications . However, the evolving nature of AI poses unique challenges and complexities associated with SaMD that may not be fully addressed by current guidelines . The effectiveness of a quality management system to ensure the safety and performance of SaMD is entirely dependent on proper implementation, adherence, continuous monitoring, and evaluation to ensure compliance with the system to address any issue that may arise . Moreover, implementing a quality management system can be costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources, and this might limit the small companies to comply with these requirements . A quality management system ensures beneficence and non-maleficence by ensuring the safety of patients and promoting their well-being. It ensures the autonomy of the patient by providing comprehensive instructions about the device and helping in making informed decisions and by promoting consistency and reliability - it builds trust in the user.Assessing the risk of an SaMD is of foremost importance in complying with the principles of medical ethics. Risk assessment refers to the process of evaluating and analyzing potential risks associated with the use of SaMD. It involves the identification of hazards, assessing the likelihood of harm and severity, and employing measures to mitigate these risks . A thorough risk assessment analysis is key to finding and addressing potential risks associated with SaMD before it gets deployed in a clinical setting . Risk assessment allows the regulatory bodies to categorize the SaMD into appropriate groups, from low risk to high risk, thus requiring controls accordingly. In this way, risk assessment helps in gaining trust and user confidence as it provides evidence of the safety and effectiveness of software . ISO 14971:2019 deals with the aspect of risk assessment of medical devices in greater detail and provides guidelines for manufacturers in the identification and elimination of risk by using proper controls . IEC/TR 80002-1 is a technical document that describes a systematic approach to risk management and serves as a guideline for developers and regulatory bodies working in the domain of SaMD . One of the major drawbacks of the current risk assessment framework is its inability to provide clarity about the extent to which the development of AI algorithms is influenced by sectoral interests . This can lead to potential conflicts of interest and biases and interfere with the safety of SaMD. Besides that, the narrow focus of the risk assessment process on intended use ignores the details regarding harmful consequences of potential unintended use . There is also no mechanism to compare two similar algorithms directly that assesses relative safety , as it\u00a0hinders the informed decision-making process in choosing between two devices. ISO 62304:2006  lays down the requirements for the life cycle of medical device software while aligning with the principle of the quality management system and risk assessment framework. Together, these international standards try to address the major issues that arise due to direct human-computer interaction and sharing of data and minimize the risk of harm, thus enabling SaMD to achieve the goals of medical ethics.AI-enabled SaMD requires a huge amount of patient data for training purposes. This gives rise to questions of data security, data privacy, and data ownership. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) plays a significant role in this regard and sets standards for the protection of sensitive patient health information (protected health information or PHI) . HIPAA ensures that the privacy and security of patient data are untouched while using AI-based systems in healthcare. Whenever AI is involved in a clinical setting, the relevant organization must comply with the regulations set by HIPAA to ensure that data are handled per privacy standards and kept securely . One of the key concepts in HIPAA is the process of de-identification. This allows researchers to use patient data without their consent as long as the data is de-identified and does not reveal any personal information. De-identification involves either removing or altering specific identifiers, thus protecting patient privacy while allowing the researchers to use data for training and analysis . HIPAA binds covered entities to conduct a risk assessment and implement appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect PHI. This includes access control measures, encryption of data, audit trails, employee training, and incident response plans . HIPAA requires the covered entities to maintain business associate agreements while working with third parties having access to PHI. This agreement outlines the obligations of business associates in protecting patient data and ensuring HIPAA compliance as well as cybersecurity measures . Even though HIPAA does provide guidelines for cybersecurity measures, it does not outline a comprehensive cybersecurity framework and leaves it to the relevant authority to ensure that all requirements for cybersecurity are met. In the European Union, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), patients have the full right to their data and decide where and how it can be used.To leverage the full potential of AI-based devices in clinical settings, addressing the barriers to adoption is the first step (Figure ). This can be achieved by understanding the perspective of healthcare professionals and taking measures to address the issues of trust, usability, and workflow integration . Workflow integration must be preceded by a thorough evaluation of ethical implications, data privacy and security, and potential biases of AI . Regulatory authorities, AI researchers, manufacturers, and healthcare organizations should collaborate to address the issues preventing the full adoption of AI technologies in healthcare settings. The collaborators must work to develop normative standards and evaluation guidelines ensuring the safety, quality, ethical aspects, and transparency of AI-based devices as well as supporting research and innovation in the field by resource allocation . The NASSS (Non-adoption, abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability) framework can also guide the AI implementation in healthcare by identifying the factors facilitating or hindering successful AI implementation . Collaboration between stakeholders and investment from the government is identified as an important\u00a0factor to build a more efficient and effective healthcare system based on AI-based technologies.One of the major hindrances in the adoption of AI-based technologies by healthcare providers is the \u201cBlack Box'' nature of AI algorithms. The Black Box nature of AI refers to the lack of transparency and interpretability of AI\u2019s decision-making process . As clinicians do not know about the factors contributing to a particular prediction made by an AI algorithm, they are skeptical to base their trust on these models . As the model is not explainable and transparent, the question of accountability and liability arise whenever adverse outcomes occur. With explainable AI, you can develop better inventory management, interpret designs easily, and reduce costs with high performance . In the healthcare system, AI-based devices and applications are also constrained by a lack of scientific evidence and adopters' acceptance and trust. The role of local champions in overcoming these barriers is crucial . Extensive research is needed in this field to make AI more trustworthy and acceptable in clinical disciplines. One approach that can be taken to make the AI algorithm more interpretable is the use of the Lorenz-Shapley model, which combines Shapley values with a statistical normalization based on Lorenz zonoids and offers a framework to make the AI model interpretable and explainable This article has several limitations. First of all, an unconventional approach to the literature search was taken. The traditional PRISMA guideline approach for systematic review with keywords \u201cArtificial intelligence\u201d, \u201cMachine Learning\u201d, \u201cDeep Learning\u201d, \u201cSoftware as Medical device\u201d, \u201cSaMD\u201d, \u201cEthics\u201d, \u201cEthical\u201d, \u201cRegulatory\u201d, \u201cRegulation\u201d did not yield enough literature to comprehensively cover the topic. Therefore, a flexible and iterative process was employed for literature search that leveraged the interconnected nature of scholarly articles. Key terms were used to identify the papers in PubMed and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) databases in the domain of AI ethics, SaMD regulations, and the regulatory process of SaMD. The process of snowballing was employed where relevant articles were identified by a constant exploration of the literature pool. Another limitation of this study is the lack of a comprehensive overview of the current regulatory framework of SaMD. Only those aspects of SaMD regulations were discussed that were directly relevant to one of the four principles of medical ethics. Finally, the field of medical ethics has gained a vast amount of new values and terms. Jobin et. al. \u00a0identified 11 clusters of ethical principles but for the sake of simplicity, but in this paper we only discussed the traditional principles of medical ethics and placed other values in those principles, for example, informed consent is mentioned as a part of autonomy while discussing the ethical principles mentioned above AI has significant potential to be leveraged for better healthcare provision by early detection and reduced time of care delivery. The existing regulatory approval process of AI-based SaMD, although successfully evaluated, fulfills the technical requirements of AI-based SaMD but the ethical questions related to their usage are still an area of research. The ethical questions that are still in research and in need of proper guidelines are data privacy, data security, and data ownership. The ethical issues arising from the use of AI technologies can be addressed by a robust and systematic SaMD approval framework developed by the collaboration between AI researchers, healthcare professionals, social scientists, and regulators. The existing regulatory frameworks are neither holistic in their approach nor universal. An extensive regulatory process encompassing all aspects of medical ethics as well as software development and clinical performance of these devices must be developed and made public. More such steps should be taken to involve the public in the decision-making process regarding these technologies as they are going to be end users for them. An approach combining both soft and hard aspects of AI-based SaMD will result in an explosion of its adoption in clinical settings and help in achieving universal healthcare.Artificial intelligence and ethics: building an artificial intelligence system that ensures privacy and social justiceSoftware as a Medical Device (SaMD): Key Definitions | International Medical Device Regulators ForumFragmentation in the future of work: A horizon scan examining the impact of the changing nature of work on workers experiencing vulnerabilityElectronic health record implementation and healthcare workers' work characteristics and autonomous motivation-a before-and-after studyPatients' and professionals' views related to ethical issues in precision medicine: a mixed research synthesisA regulatory challenge for natural language processing (NLP)-based tools such as ChatGPT to be legally used for healthcare decisions.

Researchers at Imperial College London had been investigating why certain bacteria are resistant to antibiotics, a problem that took them years to understand and prove. However, when they tested Google's AI tool 'Co-Scientist,' it reached the same conclusion in just two days, confirming their hypothesis and even presenting additional possibilities.Professor Jos\u00e9 R. Penad\u00e9s and his team had theorized that superbugs develop resistance by forming a tail composed of multiple viruses, allowing them to move between species. This hypothesis was unique to their research and had not been published or shared anywhere. To their surprise, Co-Scientist not only confirmed their findings but also suggested four additional hypotheses, all of which were valid.\"It's not just that the top hypothesis they provided was the right one,\" Penad\u00e9s told the BBC. \"It's that they provided another four, and all of them made sense. And for one of them, we never thought about it, and we're now working on that.\"The speed and accuracy of the AI tool left Penad\u00e9s in disbelief. He initially suspected that Google might have accessed his unpublished research without permission. \"I was shopping with somebody, and I said, 'Please leave me alone for an hour, I need to digest this thing,'\" he recounted. Concerned about potential data breaches, he even contacted Google to ask if they had access to his computer, but the tech giant assured him they did not.Co-Scientist, built on Google's Gemini 2.0 AI system, is designed as a \"virtual scientific collaborator\" that can generate new hypotheses and research proposals. According to Google, the tool aims to accelerate biomedical and scientific discoveries by assisting researchers in formulating new ideas. Institutions interested in using the tool can apply through a trusted tester program.. While some experts fear that AI could replace human scientists, others see it as an invaluable tool for speeding up discoveries.Despite concerns about AI's impact on jobs, Penad\u00e9s is convinced of its benefits. \"I understand the fear, but having an extremely powerful tool like this outweighs the negatives,\" he said. He described the experience as being part of a historic moment in science. \"I feel this will change science, definitely. I'm in front of something that is spectacular, and I'm very happy to be part of that. It's like you have the opportunity to be playing a big match \u2013 I feel like I'm finally playing a Champions League match with this thing.\"Stock Radar: Symmetrical Triangle breakout makes Chambal Fertilizers an attractive buy; likely to hit fresh highsMonday Horoscope February 24, 2025: Leo, Scorpio, Taurus to face challenges, here\u2019s what to expect for other zodiac signsAshok Leyland targets \u20b92,000 crore in savings with focus on leaner financial structure and profit growthA one-sided affair: India thrash Pakistan by six wickets as bowlers lay foundation and Virat Kohli drives team home with 51st ODI tonWhen you visit our website, we store cookies on your browser to collect information.
