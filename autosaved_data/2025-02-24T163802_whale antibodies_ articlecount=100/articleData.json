In addition, bevacizumab is used off-label to treat AMD, despite the absence of similar supporting data.Methods:\n        \n      \n      In a multicenter, single-blind, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned 1208 patients with neovascular AMD to receive intravitreal injections of ranibizumab or bevacizumab on either a monthly schedule or as needed with monthly evaluation. The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity at 1 year, with a noninferiority limit of 5 letters on the eye chart.Results:\n        \n      \n      Bevacizumab administered monthly was equivalent to ranibizumab administered monthly, with 8.0 and 8.5 letters gained, respectively. Bevacizumab administered as needed was equivalent to ranibizumab as needed, with 5.9 and 6.8 letters gained, respectively. Ranibizumab as needed was equivalent to monthly ranibizumab, although the comparison between bevacizumab as needed and monthly bevacizumab was inconclusive. The mean decrease in central retinal thickness was greater in the ranibizumab-monthly group (196 \u03bcm) than in the other groups (152 to 168 \u03bcm, P=0.03 by analysis of variance). Rates of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke were similar for patients receiving either bevacizumab or ranibizumab (P>0.20). The proportion of patients with serious systemic adverse events (primarily hospitalizations) was higher with bevacizumab than with ranibizumab (24.1% vs. 19.0%; risk ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.66), with excess events broadly distributed in disease categories not identified in previous studies as areas of concern.Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      At 1 year, bevacizumab and ranibizumab had equivalent effects on visual acuity when administered according to the same schedule. Ranibizumab given as needed with monthly evaluation had effects on vision that were equivalent to those of ranibizumab administered monthly. Differences in rates of serious adverse events require further study.

However, the difficulties in obtaining cetacean samples mean these animals have been poorly studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterise the different neurons and glial cells in the whale retina by immunohistochemistry using a range of molecular markers. The whale retinal neurons were analysed using different antibodies, labelling retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), photoreceptors, bipolar and amacrine cells. Finally, glial cells were also labelled, including astrocytes, M\u00fcller cells and microglia. Thioflavin S was also used to label oligomers and plaques of misfolded proteins. Molecular markers were used to label the specific structures in the whale retinas, as in terrestrial mammalian retinas. However, unlike the retina of most land mammals, whale cones do not express the cone markers used. It is important to highlight the large size of whale RGCs. All the neurofilament (NF) antibodies used labelled whale RGCs, but not all RGCs were labelled by all the NF antibodies used, as it occurs in the porcine and human retina. It is also noteworthy that intrinsically photosensitive RGCs, labelled with melanopsin, form an extraordinary network in the whale retina. The M1, M2, and M3 subtypes of melanopsin positive-cells were detected. Degenerative neurite beading was observed on RGC axons and dendrites when the retina was analysed 48 h post-mortem. In addition, there was a weak Thioflavin S labelling at the edges of some RGCs in a punctuate pattern that possibly reflects an early sign of neurodegeneration. In conclusion, the whale retina differs from that of terrestrial mammals. Their monochromatic rod vision due to the evolutionary loss of cone photoreceptors and the well-developed melanopsin-positive RGC network could, in part, explain the visual perception of these mammals in the deep sea."}, {"url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19369863/", "title": "Meat allergy", "date": "Jun, 2009", "content": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      This review summarizes the scientific evidence on meat allergy, an unusual disorder, whose prevalence in some European countries (such as Italy) may be increasing.Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Data reported in this review underline some interesting points: in meats rarely consumed, such as kangaroo, whale and seal, the main allergens are only partially correlated to those detected in beef or other usually consumed meats; cross-reactivity and cross-contamination are critical aspects, which should be seriously considered by allergologists.Summary:\n        \n      \n      Meat allergy is normally outgrown during the first years of life, so that it is rare in adults.

To date, there have been five unusual mortality events directly attributed to influenza A virus; these have primarily occurred in harbor seals in the Northeastern United States, with the most recent occurring in harbor seals in the North Sea.There are numerous additional reports wherein influenza A virus has indirectly been identified in marine mammals; these include serosurveillance efforts that have detected influenza A- and B-specific antibodies in marine mammals spanning the globe and the detection of viral RNA in both active and opportunistic surveillance in the Northwest Atlantic.

In the case of deceased animals, virus has also been detected in tissue. Surveillance has historically been somewhat limited, relying largely upon opportunistic sampling of stranded or bycaught animals and primarily occurring in response to a mortality event. A handful of active surveillance projects have shown that influenza may be more endemic in marine mammals than previously appreciated, though live virus is difficult to recover. Surveillance efforts are hindered by permitting and logistical challenges, the absence of reagents and methodology optimized for nonavian wild hosts, and low concentration of virus recovered from asymptomatic animals.

Although such fragments appear to possess in aqueous solution an unfolded conformation it is apparent, in those cases where the protein's three-dimensional structure is known, that the antibody-bound fragment possesses a folded conformation mimicking that of the corresponding portion of the whole protein. The probable explanation of this dichotomy is that the fragment has various conformations in equilibrium including a small proportion of molecules whose shape is recognized and stabilized by the antibody. A related situation can exist in the interaction of antibody(ies) with the whole protein. Thus, antibodies against an altered form of the protein can induce the native antigen to adopt the conformation of the altered form. In this case, it appears that localized regions of the protein's surface are flexible, adopting various conformations in equilibrium, one of which is stabilized (selected) by interaction with the appropriate antibody. In both instances interaction with antibody perturbs an equilibrium, leading to the selection of a particular conformation.

Also, by knowledge of the antigenic structure, the molecular factors that determine and influence antigenicity can be better understood in terms of the effects of amino acid substitutions occurring in the antigenic sites and in the environmental residues of the sites. In the present work, the myoglobins from finback whale, killer whale, horse, chimpanzee, sheep, goat, bovine, echidna, viscacha, rabbit, dog, cape fox, mouse and chicken were examined for their ability to cross-react with antisera to sperm-whale myoglobin. By immunoadsorbent titration studies with radioiodinated antibodies, each of these myoglobins was able to bind antibodies to sperm-whale myoglobin raised in goat, rabbit, chicken, cat, pig and outbred mouse. It was found that the extent of cross-reaction of a given myoglobin was not dependent on the species in which the antisera were raised. This indicated that the antibody response to sperm-whale myoglobin (i.e. its antigenic structure) is independent of the species in which the antisera are raised and is not directed to regions of sequence differences between the injected myoglobin and the myoglobin of the immunized host. Indeed, in each antiserum from a given species examined, that antiserum reacted with the myoglobin of that species. The extent of this auto-reactivity for a given myoglobin was comparable with the general extent of cross-reactivity shown by that myoglobin with antisera raised in other species. The cross-reactivities and auto-reactivities (both of which are of similar extents for a given myoglobin) can be reasonably rationalized in terms of the effects of amino acid substitutions within the antigenic sites and within the residues close to these sites.

The current study describes and compares the histomorphology and immune reaction induced by hepatic trematodes of the family Brachycladiidae in the liver of the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena, n = 8), Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli, n = 8), and Hubbs' beaked whale (Mesoplodon carlhubbsi, n = 2). Immunohistochemistry for eight antibodies (CK19, CD3, Foxp3, CD20, Iba1, CD68, CD163, and CD204) was conducted to analyze the pathology of these parasitic infections. In all three odontocete species, the changes observed in the trematode-affected biliary epithelium were comparable with marked hyperplasia and goblet cell metaplasia, as well as lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic inflammation. Additionally, regions of the Glisson's sheath were diffusely and severely fibrotic in all examined species, regardless of the physical presence of trematodes. Differences among the three species included the presence of characteristic lymphoid follicles formed in the fibrotic bile duct walls of only the two porpoise species. In the Hubbs' beaked whale, the degree of lymphoplasmacytic cholangitis was more severe, and ductular reaction was generally more prominent. In terms of the overall macrophage population among the three species, CD163- and CD204-positive cells (M2 macrophages) outnumbered Iba1- and CD68-positive cells (M1 macrophages), indicating a chronic infection stage in all analyzed individuals. Species-specific differences among the infiltrating macrophages included numbers of CD68-positive cells being significantly more abundant in the harbor porpoises, whereas CD163-positive cells were significantly more numerous in the Dall's porpoises. The numbers of CD204-positive macrophages were higher in the Hubbs' beaked whales compared to those in the porpoises. Trematode species of the harbor and Dall's porpoises were Campula oblonga, while they were Oschmarinella macrorchis in the Hubbs' beaked whales. This study concludes that interspecies differences in the tissue reactions to hepatic trematode infections are present among odontocete species and that the immune reaction varies depending on the species.

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has emerged as a useful method for monitoring changes in protein abundance and modifications in non-model species. It can be used to quantify hundreds of candidate immune molecules simultaneously without the generation of new reagents. Here, we used MS-based proteomics to identify and quantify candidate immune proteins in the plasma of the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum), a cartilaginous fish and representative of the most basal extant vertebrate lineage with an immunoglobulin-based immune system. Mass spectrometry-based LC-MS/MS was performed on the blood plasma of nurse sharks immunized with human serum albumin (n=4) or sham immunized (n=1), and sampled at days 0 (baseline control), 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, 25, 42 and 49. An antigen-specific antibody response was experimentally confirmed post-immunization.

This comprised 62,682 contigs containing open reading frames (ORFs) with a length >80 amino acids. Using this transcriptome, we reliably identified 626 plasma proteins which were broadly categorized into coagulation, immune, and metabolic functional groups. To assess the feasibility of performing LC-MS/MS proteomics in nurse shark in the absence of species-specific protein annotations, we compared the results to an alternative strategy, mapping peptides to proteins predicted in the genome assembly of a related species, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). This approach reliably identified 297 proteins, indicating that useful data on the plasma proteome may be obtained in many instances despite the absence of a species-specific reference protein database. Among the plasma proteins defined against the nurse shark transcriptome, fifteen showed consistent changes in abundance across the immunized shark individuals, indicating a role in the immune response. These included alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) and a novel protein yet to be characterized in diverse vertebrate lineages. Overall, this study enhances genetic and protein-level resources for nurse shark research and vastly improves our understanding of the elasmobranch plasma proteome, including its remodelling following immune stimulation."}, {"url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28177289/", "title": "Hepatitis E virus in bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus", "date": "Feb, 2017", "content": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects several animal species that act as zoonotic reservoirs for viral transmission.

The disease was contained within California until 1952, at which time it spread to all the major swine producing areas of the United States. The disease was eradicated in 1959, through the enforcement of laws prohibiting the feeding of raw garbage to swine. Other than the association with raw garbage, a reservoir for VES virus (VESV) was never found. In 1972, a virus isolated from California sea lions--and thus named the San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV)--proved to be distinguishable from VESV. When SMSV was injected into swine, clinical signs of vesicular exanthema developed, leading to the conclusion that, for all practical purposes, SMSV and VESV were the same. To date, 5 species of marine mammals and 2 species of terrestrial mammals, including feral swine, have been shown to possess antibodies to 1 or more of the 4 distinct SMSV serotypes.

In general, the prostate appeared as a musculo-glandular organ with two distinct parts-the Corpus prostatae and the Pars disseminata prostatae. In the pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) and the Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), the prostate was a discrete gland with a small Corpus prostatae. Microscopically, the prostates of different delphinids species shared similarities; however, the prostate of the pygmy sperm whale revealed significant histological differences compared to those of the delphinids. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using low- and high-molecular-weight cytokeratin, vimentin, and prostatic specific antigen commercial antibodies. Electron microscopy analysis was performed on the prostate of a bottlenose dolphin and the cytomorphological differences among the major epithelial components of the prostatic epithelium were described.

Beluga liver microsomes oxidized 3,3',4,4'-TCB at rates averaging 21 and 5 pmol/min per mg for males and females, respectively, while pilot whale samples oxidized this congener at 0.3 pmol/min per mg or less. However, rates of 3,3',4,4'-TCB metabolism correlated with immunodetected CYP1A1 protein content in liver microsomes of both species. The CYP1A inhibitor alpha-naphthoflavone inhibited 3,3',4,4'-TCB metabolism by 40% in beluga, supporting a role for a cetacean CYP1A as a catalyst of this activity. Major metabolites of 3,3',4,4'-TCB generated by beluga liver microsomes were 4-OH-3,3',4',5-TCB and 5-OH-3,3',4,4'-TCB (98% of total), similar to metabolites formed by other species CYP1A1, and suggesting a 4,5-epoxide-TCB intermediate. Liver microsomes of both species metabolized 2,2',5,5'-TCB at rates of 0.2-1.5 pmol/min per mg. Both species also expressed microsomal proteins cross-reactive with antibodies raised against some mammalian CYP2Bs (rabbit; dog), but not others (rat; scup). Whether CYP2B homologues occur and function in cetaceans is uncertain. This study demonstrates that PCBs are metabolized to aqueous-soluble products by cetacean liver enzymes, and that in beluga, rates of metabolism of 3,3',4,4'-TCB are substantially greater than those of 2,2',5,5'-TCB.

Although the mechanisms by which cetaceans concentrate urine have not been elucidated, data support a role for medullary urea accumulation in this process, as is the case for terrestrial mammals. Therefore, we hypothesized that facilitated urea transporters are present in the kidney of cetaceans. Using 5'/3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we cloned a 2.7-kb cDNA from the kidney of the short-finned pilot whale Globicephala macrorhynchus. The putative open-reading frame encoded a 397-amino acid protein [pilot whale urea transporter A2 (whUT-A2)] that has 94% amino acid sequence identity to the A2 isoform of the human urea transporter (hUT-A2). Heterologous expression of whUT-A2 cRNA in Xenopus oocytes induced phloretin-inhibitable urea transport. Although Northern analysis and RT-PCR indicated that whUT-A2 was exclusively expressed in kidney, Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to rat UT-A1/UT-A2 detected various immunoreactive proteins in kidney and other tissues. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis suggested the presence of alternatively spliced UT-A transcripts in the kidney as well as extrarenal tissues.

In fact, a very popular method for localization of residues in protein antigenic sites is based on the interpretation that whenever a replacement causes a change in binding to antibody, then that residue will be located in the antigenic site. To test this assumption, mAbs of predetermined specificity were prepared by immunization with a free (i.e., without coupling to any carrier) synthetic peptide representing region 94-100 of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb). The cross-reactivities and relative affinities of three mAbs with eight Mb variants were studied. Five Mb variants which had no substitutions within the boundaries of the designed antigenic site exhibited remarkable, and in two cases almost complete, loss in cross-reactivity relative to the reference antigen, sperm whale Mb. Two myoglobins, each of which had one substitution within region 94-100, showed little or no reactivity with the three mAbs. It is concluded that substitutions outside an antigenic site can exert drastic effects on the reactivity of a protein with mAbs against the site and that caution should be exercised in interpreting cross-reactivity data of proteins to implicate residues directly in an antigenic site."}, {"url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26758657/", "title": "Fluorescent microbead-based immunoassay for anti-Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae antibody detection in cetaceans", "date": "Jan, 2016", "content": "A fluorescent microbead-based immunoassay (FMIA) for detection of anti-Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae antibodies in pigs was adapted for use in cetaceans.
